# App_Subscription_Classification
Directing customers to subscription through app behavior analysis

The model can predict a new user whether "highly likely" or "unlikely" to subscribe. Based on the prediction, we can narrow the scope of marketing work to users who are not likely to subscribe, thereby increasing the number of subscriptions.
